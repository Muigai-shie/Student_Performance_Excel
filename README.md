This is an Excel Sheets projects where I have analyzed the performance of Students in University. 
I used Functions, Pivot Tables to analyze the performance of the students in different Departments.
Analyzed which group performed best and lowest, by gender and departments.
Developed insights that probably affected grades for students.
Created a Dashboard showcasing the insights using graphs and charts.
